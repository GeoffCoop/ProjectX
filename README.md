# ProjectX
## Why would we call it projectX and give a full description?
======

## The Game
We are making an rpg from scratch. We will continue to define the project as time goes on. 

Please, men, check the [wiki](https://github.com/brethren-of-awesomeness/ProjectX/wiki) as it will have useful information, resources, guides, and project definitions.

Everyone expected to put in somewhere between 2-5 hours a week. We will make assignments and divy out tasks as time goes on. Communication will be more important than fast completion, though we will expect you to finish tasks accepted. Don't feel pressured, but please update us regularly by either updating everyone during the Saturday meeting (Google Hangouts, 9:00am) or emailing Kyle.



## Resources
Please feel free to use these resources as you see fit. 

An IDE will be the best thing to Code on. For that I suggest:

*[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "VS Code")

*[Atom](https://atom.io/ "Atom")

Kyle knows VS Code well, and can help you get started. Getting plugins to help with any language is easy. Its fast to pull up and put back down, and allows debugging (so long as you understand what you are doing)
