# ProjectX
Why would we call it projectX and give a full description?
======

## The Game
We are making an rpg from scratch. We will continue to define the project as time goes on. 

## Survey Results:

Genre: Fantasy

Platform: Browser or Application

Gameflow: Freeworld with main campaign and possibly side quests

Game Focus: Adventure over Combat

Features we would like to add:
  Fighting 
  Theiving 
  Questing 
  Dungeon Crawling 
  Puzzle Solving 
  and many, many more. 

Most likely solo

Real time combat as opposed to turn based.

Character creation is likely to follow a class path, potentially large skill trees

Stats used may include:

  Health

  Mana

  Strength

  Agility/Dexterity

  Intelligence

  Charisma (or eq. social attribute)

  Speed

Growth will be important, but we will probably make leveling fairly slow with great benefits.

Items can be found and purchased, and potentially upgraded, consumed, dropped as loot, and maybe crafted and broken.

Money will be around, but never enough to solve all your woes.

Items will include

  Head

  Chest

  Hands

  1-2 rings

  Legs

  Boots

  and possibly belts and trinkets/totems

Armour will boost your characters toughness, and heavier armour will come with drawbacks. Discussion will follow for details.

Ammunition is likely to be in play this game.

Health will appear as hit points, though a healhbar from health points is a simple addition.

Inventory capacity will be realistic, meaning weight and size will be important for items

Discussion to follow on travel and movement, though it seems likely to have an interconnected map (more than one way to access many places) with fast travel available as the game goes on.

Statuses inflicted during combat may include poisoning, sleep, slowed, weakness, stunned, bleeded, dying, "Beast Mode", but all is open to discussion.


Everyone expected to put in somewhere between 2-5 hours a week. We will make assignments and divy out tasks as time goes on. Communication will be more important than fast completion, though we will expect you to finish tasks accepted.

 


## Resources
Please feel free to use these resources as you see fit. 

An IDE will be the best thing to Code on. For that I suggest:

*[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "VS Code")

*[Atom](https://atom.io/) "Atom"

Kyle knows VS Code well, and can help you get started. Getting plugins to help with any language is easy. Its fast to pull up and put back down, and allows debugging (so long as you understand what you are doing)
