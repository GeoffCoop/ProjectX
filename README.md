# ProjectX

## The Game
We are making an rpg from scratch. We will continue to define the project as time goes on. 

## Ideas
All ideas are welcome as we will continue to develop this game from the ground up. Whatever we decide will happen will happen. Ideas can be put in the [ideas](https://github.com/brethren-of-awesomeness/ProjectX/blob/develop/Misc/Ideas.md) page. Its purpose is to just be a brain dump for the group. Please use it. I want this to be interactive and to come home and be like "Oh, look what so-and-so added today, what a great idea.

## Wiki
Please, men, check the [wiki](https://github.com/brethren-of-awesomeness/ProjectX/wiki) as it will have useful information, resources, guides, and project definitions. If you run into problems, check here. It will be expanded as time goes on, and will (hopefully) grow in to the one stop resource we need it to be.

## Work Load
Everyone expected to put in somewhere between 2-5 hours a week. We will make assignments and divy out tasks as time goes on. Communication will be more important than fast completion, though we will expect you to finish tasks accepted. Don't feel pressured, but please update us regularly by either updating everyone during the Saturday meeting (Google Hangouts, 9:00am) or emailing Kyle.
